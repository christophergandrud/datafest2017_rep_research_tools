## Is this research?

![](img/cox.png)

## No

> Papers, articles, slideshows, talks, books are **advertising, not research**.

## What are journal articles/books/etc?

> **Presentation documents**: announce select findings and try to convince an 
audience that they are correct [@Mesirov2010].

## What is research?

Quantitative research involves the **procedures** and **choices** researchers make to **gather** data, **process** it, and **analysis** it in order to address their research questions.

<br>
<br>

This includes “the **full software environment**, code, and data that produced the results” [@Donoho2010, 3015].

## Quants and computer programming

> The practice of quantitative science **is computer programming**.

# Plan

## Skills checklist

- Reproducible research **workflow** with **literate programming**

> - Create a new **R Markdown** document that outputs to PDF and HTML

> - **Markdown** and **YAML** syntax

> - **R code chunks** into R Markdown documents that gathers data and outputs results

> - **Pandoc** citations

## Following along

In this workshop we will create a fake research project using the literate programming tool R Markdown. 

## What you need

- Installed:

    + R and RStudio
    
    + `rmarkdown` package for R

    + GitHub Desktop/GitHub account

    + LaTeX (if you want to output to PDFs)

- Working internet connection
